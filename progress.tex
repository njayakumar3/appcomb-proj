\titlesub{Part 2: Progress Report}{Topic: Distributed Systems Integrity and Correctness}

This is because it is intimately intertwined with all kinds of networking across the web (although it's becoming more centralized as time goes on), torrent software, the TOR network, server redundancy in commercial applications, and the almighty cryptocurrency. % Are all of them necessary? If so, long sentence.
